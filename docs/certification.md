# Certification Contract Explanation

The `Certification` contract is an ERC721 non-fungible token contract that represents certificates.  It inherits from the `CreditToken` contract (the contents of which are not provided here, but are assumed to contain relevant functionality for managing credits).

## Key Features

*   **ERC721 Implementation:**  The contract uses the OpenZeppelin ERC721 standard for managing non-fungible tokens.
*   **Certificate Minting:** The `mint` function allows for the creation of new certificates.
*   **Token URI:** The `tokenURI` function is a placeholder and needs to be implemented to generate the actual URI for each certificate.  This URI would typically point to metadata about the certificate (e.g., on IPFS).
*   **Burning:** The contract includes functionality for burning tokens (`addBurnedTokens` and `burnTokens` - the latter is assumed to exist in the `CreditToken` contract).
*   **Ownership and Approvals:**  The contract manages token ownership and approvals using mappings (`idToOwner`, `idToApproval`).
*   **Counter:** Uses OpenZeppelin's `Counters` library to track token IDs.

## Data Structures and Mappings

*   `idToOwner`: Maps token IDs to their owners.
*   `idToApproval`: Maps token IDs to approved addresses.
*   `ownerToNFTokenCount`: Tracks the number of tokens owned by each address.
*   `burnedTokens`: Tracks the number of burned tokens for each address.

## Functions

*   `mint`: Mints new certificates.
*   `addBurnedTokens`: Adds burned tokens to the count for a given address.  This function relies on the `burnTokens` function (presumably from the `CreditToken` contract).
*   `tokenURI`:  A placeholder function that needs to be implemented to return the URI for a given token ID.

## Important Considerations

*   The `CreditToken` contract is crucial for understanding the complete functionality of this contract.  The provided code snippet only shows a partial picture.
*   The `tokenURI` function needs to be fully implemented to point to actual metadata for the certificates.
*   Error handling should be improved for production use.

This document provides a high-level overview of the `Certification` contract.  Refer to the contract's source code and the `CreditToken` contract for detailed implementation specifics.
