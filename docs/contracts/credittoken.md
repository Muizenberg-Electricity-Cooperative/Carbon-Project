# CreditToken Contract Explanation

The `CreditToken` contract is an ERC20 token contract that represents carbon credits. It inherits from the `CarbonCredits` contract (the contents of which are not provided here, but are assumed to contain relevant functionality for managing carbon credits).

## Key Features

*   **ERC20 Implementation:** The contract uses the OpenZeppelin ERC20 standard for managing fungible tokens.
*   **Token Creation and Transfer:** Functions for creating (`createCarbonToken`), transferring (`transferCredits`, `transferCreditsFrom`), and burning (`burnTokens`) tokens are included.
*   **Credit Approval:** Verifiers can approve credits held by credit holders (`approveCreditsHeld`).
*   **Access Control:** Modifiers (`onlyVerifier`, `onlyCreditHolder`) restrict access to certain functions based on the sender's role.
*   **Buying Credits:** Customers can buy credits using the `buyCarbonCredits` function.

## Data Structures and Mappings

*   `balanceOf`: Tracks the balance of each address.
*   `approvedCredits`: Tracks approved credits for each address.
*   `tokensApprovedForBurn`: Tracks tokens approved for burning for each address.

## Functions

*   `approveCreditsHeld`: Approves credits held by a credit holder (only callable by verifiers).
*   `createCarbonToken`: Creates carbon tokens based on approved credits (only callable by credit holders).
*   `transferCredits`: Transfers credits between addresses (only callable by credit holders).
*   `transferCreditsFrom`: Transfers credits from one address to another (anyone can call this).
*   `approveBurn`: Approves tokens for burning (only callable by verifiers).
*   `burnTokens`: Burns approved tokens (only callable by the owner).
*   `buyCarbonCredits`: Allows customers to buy carbon credits.

## Important Considerations

*   The `CarbonCredits` contract is crucial for understanding the complete functionality of this contract. The provided code snippet only shows a partial picture.
*   The contract assumes the existence of verifiers and credit holders, as defined in the `CarbonCredits` contract.
*   Error handling and input validation should be improved for production use.  For example, the `buyCarbonCredits` function lacks checks to ensure sufficient funds are sent.
